### Projects
1. **Credit Risk Calssifier**: Develop a credit risk classifier service as an API with BentoML and GCP using XGBoost to predict the likelihood of default and assist credit risk management. [Code](https://github.com/rahmatmamat1/credit-risk-classifier-bentoml)
2. **AdTracking Fraud Detection**: Create a fraud detection model using XGBoost on ad tracking data and deploy it as a service using FastAPI and GCP to detect and prevent fraudulent activity. [Code](https://github.com/rahmatmamat1/machine-learning-zoomcamp/tree/main/08-mid-term-project)
3. **Customer Churn Prediction**: Design and build a customer churn prediction service using Logistic Regression model and deploy as an API with Flask and GCP to identify at-risk customers and mitigate the potential loss of revenue. [Code](https://github.com/rahmatmamat1/churn-prediction-fastapi)
4. **Lung Segmentation on Chest X-Ray Image**: Design and develop segmentation model using U-Net Architecture and deploy as an API with Flask and TensorFlow Serving. [Code](https://github.com/rahmatmamat1/unet_lung_segmentation)
5. **Occupancy of isolation rooms and ICUs**: Designed and implemented a model to predict the occupancy of isolation rooms and ICUs in Jakarta using the ARIMA method to support decision-making in healthcare operations during the COVID pandemic. [Code](https://github.com/rahmatmamat1/Project_DataScience/tree/main/ICU%20and%20Isolation%20Room%20Prediction)
6. **Movie Recommendation System**: Develop a recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques that improves customer retention and generate revenue. [Code](https://github.com/rahmatmamat1/Project_DataScience/blob/main/Movie_Recomendation_using_collaborative_filtering.ipynb)
7. **Language Identifier**: Building model that can idetify languages using natural language processing techniques and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. [Code](https://github.com/rahmatmamat1/Project_DataScience/blob/main/Language_Identifier_using_LSTM.ipynb)
8. **Rainfall Forcasting in Makassar, Indonesia**: Forecast the rainfall in Makassar using Neural Network. 
9. **Customer Segmentation**: Utilize DBSCAN and K-Prototype methods to segment and analyze customer data to identify key segments for targeted marketing strategies. [Code](https://github.com/rahmatmamat1/Project_DataScience/blob/main/Costumer_Segmentation_using_K_Prototype_and_DBSCAN.ipynb)
10. **Youtube Trending Videos Analysis**: Analyze the trending videos on YouTube by creating visualizations to gain insights into the types of videos that are trending and what keywords are commonly used in their titles. [Code](https://github.com/rahmatmamat1/youtube-trending-videos-analysis)
